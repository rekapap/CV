## Profile

### Where did my interest start
It started with building simple websites in CSS and HTML or using Joomla. Meanwhile, I was teaching myself Photoshop, Illustrator and other design softwares. Later on, my software engineer partner started quizzing me on various programming questions just for fun. That's when my interests fully got peaked. <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokedex/bulbasaur" target="_blank">🥚</a> Since then I enjoy solving problems on various websites like Codewars, Hackerrank, Leetcode etc.

### Where I Work Best
In an open-minded, motivated and moderately geeky tech team who work to high standards while having fun at the same time. Preferably while watching Avengers. I also add graphic design skills to the team, but I'm committed to a career change as a Full-Stack or Back-end developer.

### What I'm currently working on
Expanding my 'horizon' by learning new things, like Data Structures, Phaser.js, P5.js, Java, iOS Mobile App development using Swift etc.

### What I Bring
- High-Level Design Skills / Architecture
(e.g. [Database Server Tech Test](https://github.com/rekapap/database_server_tech_test), [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/rekapap/gilded-rose) or [Takeaway](https://github.com/rekapap/takeaway-challenge))
- Problem Solving ([🥚](https://i.imgur.com/jvBVely.jpg) e.g. [Problem solving](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving) or [Java Problem Solving](https://github.com/rekapap/Java-problem-solving))
- Deep interest in tech languages and libraries (e.g. [Java](https://github.com/rekapap/Java-problem-solving), [C#](https://github.com/rekapap/numberwizard), [C++](http://hr.gs/gutgem), [Python](https://github.com/rekapap/RPG-pyGame), [p5.js](https://github.com/rekapap/Halftone_effect_p5), [Swift](https://github.com/rekapap/secret-santa-mobile-app) etc.)
- Self-Led Learning (e.g. [Data Structures](https://github.com/rekapap/data-structures) or other programming languages, see above)
- Attention to detail (I like things to be 'pixel-perfect', a skill that I developed during my designer years)
- Helping others (During the course and precourse I tried to share my knowledge with my peers as best as I could. I also mentored an other Maker from a cohort after mine.)
- Graphic Design skills including PhotoShop, Illustrator, InDesign ([see my design portfolio here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5esC9AcPyIETVFMWkNBSkpLR3VScy1ocVYzZmhxNW5VbTZB/view?usp=sharing))
